.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
The standard invocation of the command is as follows with no options or
arguments, which causes a boot loader configuration file to be (re)generated
based on settings in \fI/etc/boot.conf\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBboot\-update\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Typically, \fBboot\-update\fP would be run if the contents of \fI/etc/boot.conf\fP
were changed by the user, or additional kernels were installed. This would allow
the boot loader menu to reflect these changes.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fIboot\-update\fP is a system tool developed by Daniel Robbins of Funtoo that
will generate a boot loader configuration file based on settings stored in
\fI/etc/boot.conf\fP\&. \fIboot\-update\fP was originally created as an enhanced
replacement of the upstream GRUB\-1.97+ configuration system. GRUB\-1.97+\(aqs boot
loader configuration file is stored at \fI/boot/grub/grub.cfg\fP, is quite
complex and is not intended to be edited directly by system administrators.
.sp
\fIboot\-update\fP has since been extended to support GRUB (\fIsys\-boot/grub\fP), GRUB
Legacy (\fIsys\-boot/grub\-legacy\fP) and LILO (\fIsys\-boot/lilo\fP) to boot systems in
MBR (legacy) mode. In addition, GRUB also supports auto\-detecting and configuring
UEFI booting. If boot\-update detects that your system has booted in UEFI mode,
it will create a UEFI\-compatible configuration file automatically.
.sp
Boot\-update allows a single file, \fI/etc/boot.conf\fP, to store boot\-related information in a
boot\-loader\-independent way, thus simplifying boot loader configuration and
providing advanced features to all popular boot loaders.
.sp
The normal way to use \fIboot\-update\fP is to run the command with no options
or arguments as root, which will cause a new boot loader configuration file
to be generated. For detailed information on the process that \fIboot\-update\fP
uses to generate boot loader configuration files, please see \fIboot.conf(5)\fP\&.
